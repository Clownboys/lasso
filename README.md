# Learn the Ropes!
## A GlobalGameJam 2024 game 

VR clown-wrangling game for Oculus Quest

Tested on Quest 3. Probably works on 2 & Pro.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHpE9YZ7sA

Directions:
- Not left hand friendly :(
- Triggers (not grip!) grab rope. Rope slides through hand when trigger is released.
- Swing heavy rope end around head and release both triggers to let it fly!
- Completely physics & technique based. Takes some practice to throw well
- Wrangle in clowns, but avoid cacti!
- Cacti and clown guns don't cause any penalty currently
