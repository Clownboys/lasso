Directions:
- Not left hand friendly :(
- Triggers (not grip!) grab rope. Rope slides through hand when trigger is released.
- Swing heavy rope end around head and release both triggers to let it fly!
- Wrangle clowns, but avoid cacti (there is no implemented penalty for cacti though)!
- Completely physics & technique based. Takes some practice to throw well. Your arm will get tired :)
